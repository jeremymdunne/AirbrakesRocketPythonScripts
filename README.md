This is a collection of scripts for use in the Case Rocket Team's Air Brake Rocket 


Some of these scripts are stand alone tests of algorithms to be implemented on an embedded platform
Others are meant to perform real time simulations with the vehicle for testing purposes 

These scripts were made in collaboration with members of the Case Rocket Team
